# Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and segmenting customers into meaningful groups using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses better understand customer patterns for targeted decision-making.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer data often lacks labeled outcomes. This project applies unsupervised learning to identify natural groupings in customer behavior without predefined labels.

## ⚙️ Techniques & Algorithms Used
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Feature Scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection
- Silhouette Score for clustering performance comparison

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📈 Key Outcomes
- Identified distinct customer segments based on behavioral patterns
- Compared multiple clustering algorithms to select optimal models
- Interpreted clusters to derive business insights

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Customer_Segmentation_Clustering.ipynb`
3. Run all cells sequentially
